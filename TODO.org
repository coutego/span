#+title: To be implemented

* DONE Feature: Core - Implement Global State Logic
Update `org-chronos-compute-day` in `org-chronos-core.el` to determine the global state of the day based on the last event.
States defined in DESIGN.md:
- PRE-START (No events)
- ACTIVE (Last event: DAY_START or CTX_SWITCH)
- INTERRUPTED (Last event: INTERRUPTION)
- FINISHED (Last event: STOP)

* DONE Bug: some shortcuts don't work
Those are: 's', 't', 'f'. It seems that they have in common that are evil motion commands. I think that evil shortcuts are conflicting with the commands defined by this package
