#+title: To be implemented


* DONE Feature: Core - Implement Global State Logic
Update `org-chronos-compute-day` in `org-chronos-core.el` to determine the global state of the day based on the last event.
States defined in DESIGN.md:
- PRE-START (No events)
- ACTIVE (Last event: DAY_START or CTX_SWITCH)
- INTERRUPTED (Last event: INTERRUPTION)
- FINISHED (Last event: STOP)

* DONE Feature: UI - Dynamic Action Strip
Refactor `org-chronos--insert-action-strip` in `org-chronos-ui.el`.
It should accept the global state computed in the previous task and render the specific keys/actions defined in DESIGN.md (Section 4).
- PRE-START: [s] Start, [n/p] Nav, [q] Quit
- ACTIVE: [c] Clock In, [o] Out, [i] Interrupt, [t] Tick, [r] Refresh, [R] Report, [q] Quit
- FINISHED: [c] Resume, [R] Report, [q] Quit

* DONE Feature: Input - Implement Start Day and Date Navigation
1. Implement `org-chronos-start-day`: Logs a `DAY_START` event.
2. Implement `org-chronos-prev-day` and `org-chronos-next-day`:
   - Needs a buffer-local variable or global variable to track the "viewed date" (currently defaults to today).
   - Refresh dashboard with new date.

* TODO Feature: Input - Contextual Timeline Actions (Delete/Merge)
Implement logic to act on the specific interval under the cursor in the dashboard.
- `[d] Delete`: Identify the event that started the current interval and remove it from the log.
- `[M] Merge Up`: Effectively the same as delete (merges current time into previous block).

* TODO Feature: Input - Contextual Timeline Actions (Split/Edit)
- `[S] Split`: Prompt user for a time within the selected interval. Insert a new `CTX_SWITCH` event at that time.
- `[e] Edit Time`: Allow modifying the timestamp of the event that started the selected interval.

* TODO Feature: Input - Gap Filling
- `[f] Fill Gap`: When cursor is on a Gap (red block), allow inserting a `CTX_SWITCH` at the start of that gap to retroactively log work.
