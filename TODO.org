#+title: To be implemented

* DONE Feature: implement linking org-mode headlines to tasks
Use CHRONOS_ID properties to keep links to tasks (headlines)
in chronos.

A previous implementation of the feature used the code in temp.el.
Now that functionality should live behing an eli.el interface and
be used through the IoC, without having to depend on the implementation.

This task includes the design and creation of the interface to be used,  and
writing tests for that implementation.
