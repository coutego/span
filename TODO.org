* TODO Bug: non attributed period not deleted
When pressing 'f' to attribute a task to a '<non attributed>' period,
the new one is added, but the <non attributed> is kept, with zero minutes

* TODO Bug: command 'f' not shown in the menu when selecting a non attributed task
When the cursor is over a line with a '<non attributed>' period, no 'f'
is shown in the menu, even though 'f' works as a keystroke
