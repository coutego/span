#+title: To be implemented

* DONE Feature: bold face for tasks in the dashboard
The tasks in the dashboard should be shown in bold, rathen than regular font
to make the pop out easier


* DONE Bug: duplicated tasks shown in the dashboard
When clocking in a new task 'Tarefa 2', the task is shown twice:

[ TIMELINE ]
   20:27 - 20:28   Tarefa 1
   20:28 -  ...    Tarefa 2
   20:28 -  ...    Tarefa 2

When clocking in another task, the ducplication dissapears:


[ STATUS ]
   Active:  New task
   Elapsed: 0m


[ ACTIONS ]
   [c] Clock In   [i] Interrupt   [t] Tick   [r] Refresh   [q] Quit

[ TIMELINE ]
   20:27 - 20:28   Tarefa 1
   20:28 - 20:33   Tarefa 2
   20:33 -  ...    New task
      ID: 800f90b7-659f-4494-9135-c5ee0ed0954b
      Type: :ctx-switch
   20:33 -  ...    New task

* TODO Feature: implement the 'clock out' command
It must be extremelly realiable, guiding the user if any
conflict or question is found

* DONE Feature: make 'clock in' command to offer current heading
Add a new option to the clock in command, when in an org-mode buffer
to clock in the current heading

* TODO Bug: 'clock-in' changes buffer even if not in the dashboard
When the clock-in command is run, the current buffer changes (to the
previous one?) rather than staying in the current one.
