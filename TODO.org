#+title: To be implemented


* DONE Bug: the list of actions overflows to the right if buffer view is narrow
For example, in this case the view is cut after 'Qu':

ORG-CHRONOS  ::  Wednesday, November 26, 2025
============================================================
[ STATUS ]
   Active:  Nothing


[ ACTIONS ]
   [c] Clock In   [o] Clock Out   [i] Interrupt   [t] Tick   [r] Refresh   [R] Hard Refresh   [q] Quit

[ TIMELINE ]

* TODO Feature: design the statuses, actions per status and transitions
- If there are no tasks logged in a day, the only action should be 'Start Day'
- New actions should be created:
  - Start Day
  - Finish Day
  - Produce Report
- If the cursor is over a task, at least these actions should be available:
  - Delete Time
  - Split Time (the user should be able to chose the split time, whether to keep the task at the beginning or at the end and chose or create a task)
  - Change duration (time can be taken from previous or next time)
  - Refresh

Design the detailed list of possible statuses of org-chronos, the substatuses (depending on the row selected, etc.), the actions in each (sub)status and
the transition between them
